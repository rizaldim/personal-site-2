My name is Rizaldi Martaputra. I have been working in software development
since 2013. The first 2 years as a freelance and then after that as full-time
employee in Bridestory and Tokopedia, both are tech companies in
Indonesia with the latter acquired the former in the end of 2019.

For the first few years in Bridestory I worked as Android App Developer. But
then I moved around a little bit (infra team to web team to Android to infra to
Android and back to infra) and now I identify myself as software engineer who
works in system and cloud infrastucture. Since October 2020 I have been working
in Tokopedia's Cloud Platform Team. I will be here until the end of March 2021.
It's a temporary assignment because of Covid-19.  After that I will move to a
new team (still waiting for it to be official).

Nowadays I do my work in office hours and outside of that if I have spare time
I am learning about IT security, especially pentesting. It's just a side
project kind of thing right now but who knows, maybe one day I can transition
to become one.

I am from Padang, Indonesia but now live in Jakarta with my wife and her calico cat.
Until now I still don't know if the cat likes me or hates me.
