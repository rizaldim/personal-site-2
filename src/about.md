My name is Rizaldi Martaputra. I have been working in software development
since 2013. The first 2 years as a freelance and then after that as full-time
employee in Bridestory and Tokopedia, both are tech companies in
Indonesia with the latter acquired the former in the end of 2019.

For the first few years in Bridestory I worked as Android App Developer. But
then I moved around a little bit (infra team to web team to Android to infra to
Android and back to infra) and now I works in system and cloud infrastucture.
Since October 2020 I have been working in Tokopedia's Cloud Platform Team. I
will be here until the end of March 2021.  It's a temporary assignment because
of Covid-19.  After that I will move to a new team, probably.

I am from Padang, Indonesia but now live in Jakarta with my wife and her calico cat.
Until now I still don't know if the cat likes me or hates me.

If you want to hire me or work with me or anything, feel free to check
<a href="/cv/">my cv</a>.  It's still in constant update as we speak.
